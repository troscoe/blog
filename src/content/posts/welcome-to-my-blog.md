# Welcome!

I'm excited to launch my new blog, built with modern web technologies that prioritize performance, accessibility, and great user experience.

## Why This Stack?

I chose **Astro** as the foundation for this blog because:

- **Zero JavaScript by default** - Pages load instantly
- **Islands architecture** - Interactive components only where needed
- **Perfect for content** - Built-in markdown support and content collections
- **Great developer experience** - Hot reload, TypeScript, and modern tooling

Combined with **shadcn/ui** for accessible, customizable components and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, this blog achieves:

- ⚡ First Contentful Paint < 1 second
- ♿ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design
- 🚀 100% static, deployed to GitHub Pages for free

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Web development best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Accessibility tips and tricks
- My journey building projects

Stay tuned for more content!

## Code Example

Here's a quick example of how simple Astro components are:

\`\`\`astro
---
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
---

<h1>{greeting}</h1>
<p>Welcome to my blog built with Astro.</p>
\`\`\`

Simple, clean, and fast. That's the goal!
